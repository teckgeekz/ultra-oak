    questions:
      - question: How long does shipping take?
        answer: >
          Now that’s a frequent one all right, ain’t it? Your answer to this
          should *manage customer expectations*. Just like a good checkout flow
          should. Tell them the truth:


          *   Domestic will take between 3 to 5 business days.

          *   International shipping will take between 5 and 10 business days.

          *   Mars shipping will be automatically redirected to Elon Musk’s
          Twitter account.
      - question: How do refunds and returns work?
        answer: >
          It happens. Even the most beautiful of plants will disappoint
          *someone*. Again, tell it like it is:


          *   All discounted items sales are final.

          *   If you’d like another version of your item, please use the return
          label. Instructions are printed on its back.

          *   If your item is damaged or not functioning correctly, email us at
          sales@shopfacesheild.com, and we’ll refund you + send you a new one
          ASAP!
